# ML-Modelling-App
This application is a Streamlit dashboard that can be used to analyse the performance of ML models.

### Use Case: Spotify Recommendations
Can you teach Spotify the kind of music to suggest to you by categorising songs into liked and disliked? Take this dataset as an example. Several variables defining the music such as key, danceability, energy, acousticness, etc. can be retrieved from [Spotify's API]https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api.
